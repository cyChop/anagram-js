## History

I love trying to find anagrams, but sometimes (especially with long phrases), trying to keep track
of letters you already used and letters still available can be a pain, so I wanted to make a small
tool to do this for me.

This was also the occasion for me to try a more formal way to do some JavaScript, with automation,
unit testing, and so on.

## What it is and is not

This JavaScript allows you to find which anagrams can or cannot be made using a set of letters,
provided **you** do the search.

It is **not** a script running automatically through a dictionary to find the possible
rearrangements. You will find plenty of those already, and though it is funny, it is not in the
current scope of this project.

## Roadmap

* [x] Get started with Grunt
  * [x] Basics
  * [x] JSHint
  * [x] QUnit
  * [ ] Documentation generation
* [ ] Implement the JavaScript functions
  * [x] Implementation and testing
  * [ ] Documentation
* [ ] ~~Continuous integration~~ (this is a one-shot project, forget the CI)
  * [ ] ~~Travis~~
  * [ ] ~~Coveralls~~
  * [ ] Clean what was begun for CI
* [ ] Create a ``gh-pages`` branch: use the script and two inputs to make something people can use
